I'm a oceanographer pursuing a master's in physical oceanography with a focus in submesoscale phenomena. I'm my undergrad thesis I focused in a large scale phenomena, the [Brazil Current Inner Recirculation Cell](link), where I've done a descriptive and a numerical modeling approach. Now at my Master's, I'm working in [César Barbedo Rocha](https://cesar-rocha.github.io/)'s group, where I'm researching about submesoscale fronts sampled during the [SMODE](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/S-MODE) IOP1 field campaign, and I'll be working mostly with [Oceananigans](https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable/).

I'm also very interested in Scientific Communication for non-scientific groups, during my undergrad I was a member of the [UNESCO Chair on Ocean Sustainability](https://oceano.iea.usp.br/) where I mostly worked with the divulgation of Ocean Culture in social media and organizing in person scientific events.
