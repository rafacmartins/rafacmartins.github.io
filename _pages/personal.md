Here you can find a non-exhaustive list of projects that I pursue mostly on my free time. Feel free
to reach out if you're interested in any of them.


<!-- ## Oceananigans

I'm a regular contributor to
[Oceananigans](https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable/), a Julia package that
provides an efficient and user-friendly way to run large-eddy simulations (among other things) on
[CPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit) and
[GPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit). I also created a companion package
[Oceanostics](https://github.com/tomchor/Oceanostics.jl), which provides easy diagnostics to
Oceananigans. -->
