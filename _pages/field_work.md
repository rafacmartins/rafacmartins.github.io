During my undergrad time I've done a few of field work. Below you can see some beautiful pictures of those opportunities.

### SAMBAR 3 Cruise - Offshore of Brazil and Uruguay coast (July-August 2022)

Field work in the Offshore waters of Brasil and Uruguay coast. The objective of this work was to recover the C-Pies, which were deployed a few years before, and conduct some CTD stations along the SAMBAR transect at 34.5S. This field work was part of the [SAMBAR](https://carbonteam.furg.br/projetos/10-pesquisa/38-projeto-sambar) project and the Scientific Leader of this cruise was [Olga T. Sato](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4Q4Xx34AAAAJ&hl=en).
